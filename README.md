# üßÆ Calculator Project ‚Äì Assembly (Shared)

üë• Shared with ALI CS Club

---

This is the **shared Assembly calculator repository** for ALI CS Club members.  
It focuses on implementing a terminal-based calculator using low-level x86 or x86_64 Assembly language.  
Due to the nature of Assembly, there is **no GUI version** planned ‚Äî only CLI.

## üß† Purpose

This project helps reinforce:

- Procedural flow control with jumps, conditionals, and stack operations
- Appreciation for how higher-level language features map to CPU instructions


The old-school way!
